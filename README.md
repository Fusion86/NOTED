# NOTED Plugin

A Final Fantasy XIV Dalamud Plugin that lets you create notes that are linked to specific duties.


## Usage

A note is assigned to a one (and only one) duty.
Whenever you are in that duty, the note will show automatically.

You can have several notes for the same duty and you can apply job filters to them.
Whenever there is more than one applicable note, the first one found in the list will be used.
